# Personal Blog Hugo Repo
Hello, this is a hugo repo I put together to manage my personal site.
I put this README here for when I inevitably stop working on this and come back to it 3 months later.

## Build Process
Build the hugo project, there's a git subdirectory that points to my personal GH pages site.
Once you build the hugo project it will update the underlying personal site repo, just push those
changes and then it should flow through to the actual site.
